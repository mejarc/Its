It's
=============
_It's_ is a contraction, short for:

+ it is
+ it has

For example,  
_It's irritating to see "it's" misused on Wikipedia._
********************************
Its
=============
********************************
Its
=============
_Its_ is most often a possessive adjective[*](#ref1), meaning "belonging to It," or "It has."

For example,  
_Let's give "it's" its own page on Wikipedia._


<p id="ref1">* It's valid, but uncommon, to use <em>its</em> as a pronoun:<br />
<em>The World Book Encyclopedia has its fans, and Wikipedia has its</em>.
</p>


********************************
Its'
=============
********************************

<div class="wrong">
<h1>Its'</h1>
</div>

Does not exist in standard English.

********************************
Why they are confused
=============

+ _Its_ and _it's_ and  (so help me) _<span class="wrong">its'</span>_ are pronounced the same
+ So many other possessives in English are formed using the apostrophe

For example,  
_Wikipedia's tenth anniversary:  its most widely celebrated one so far._

********************************
History of It's
=============

_It's_ seems to be rather a latecomer in English.  

********************************
History of It's
=============

_Its_ seems to have prevailed as both a contraction and a possessive in the 17th century.  In the 18th century, _it's_ was favored[[1]](#ref2).

********************************
History of It's
=============

_Its_ and _it's_ seemed to have enjoyed equal popularity in the 19th century [[1]](#ref3), yet by 1918 were prescribed for different usages[[2]](#ref4).

It's and its friends
=============
********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ Let's
********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ *Let's* is short for "Let us."

For example,  
_Let's not confuse "let's" with "lets."_

Not:  
<em>Wikipedia <span class="wrong">let's</span> me add a new article about "it's."</em>

********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ Let's
+ *Who's*
********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ Let's
+ *Who's* is a contraction for "Who is" or "Who has."

For example,  
_Who's confusing "who's" with "whose?"_

Not:  
<em><span  class="wrong">Who's</span> vandalism is this?!</em>

********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ Let's
+ Who's
+ *There's*
********************************
It's and its friends
=============
+ Let's
+ Who's
+ *There's* is a contraction, meaning "There has" or "There is."

For example,  
_There's another sock puppet!_

Not:  
<em>These guys seem to think the Talk page is all <span  class="wrong">there's</span>.</em>
